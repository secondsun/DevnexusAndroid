How did a bunch of math geeks almost destroy the financial world? How can you build simpler architectures that scale? How are types of presentations like software designs? This keynote delves into these unexpected relationships and explores what they tell us about the intersection of the real world with software. Software is eating the world, and the geeks who write the code cook the buffet.\r\n",

                    "description": "NoSQL databases such as Redis, MongoDB and Cassandra are emerging as a compelling choice for many applications. They can simplify the persistence of complex data models and offer significantly better scalability and performance. However, using a NoSQL database means giving up the benefits of the relational model such as SQL, constraints and ACID transactions. For some applications, the solution is polyglot persistence: using SQL and NoSQL databases together.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, you will learn about the benefits and drawbacks of polyglot persistence and how to design applications that use this approach. We will explore the architecture and implementation of an example application that uses MySQL as the system of record and Redis as a very high-performance database that handles queries from the front-end. You will learn about mechanisms for maintaining consistency across the various databases.\r\n",

Proper craftsmanship demands that we write the best Java code that we can possibly write. Fortunately we have a guide in Joshua Bloch's Effective Java.\r\n\r\nIn his foreword to the first edition, Guy Steele writes about the importance of learning three aspects of any language: grammar, vocabulary, and idioms. Unfortunately many programmers stop learning after mastering the first two. Effective Java is your guide to understanding idiomatic Java programming.\r\n\r\nEffective Java is organized into 78 standalone \"items,\" all of which will be impossible to cover in one session. Instead I've chosen a subset of the most important techniques and practices that are commonly missed by today's Java programmers. You'll pick from a menu and decide where we'll head. Regardless of the path we take, you'll leave this session thoroughly equipped to write better Java code tomorrow!\r\n",

By the end of the presentation, you'll understand how Gradle helps to elegantly solve the challenges that we face in our daily builds. We'll go through such powerful concepts as: advantages of declarative over imperative build systems, convention over configuration without rigidity, the Gradle plugins, deep multi–project support, performance optimizations through partial builds and incrementalness, harvesting existing functionality through Ant and Maven integration, as well as migration strategies for migrating from these build tools. We will demonstrate many of the innovative goodies that come with Gradle out–of–the–box, like the Gradle Daemon, the Gradle Wrapper, easy administration of your build environment, building Android apps and libraries, Eclipse integration, and other new plugins.",

And the easiest way to address performance issues was to add a faster CPU. However, that option is no longer viable as the hardware industry has shifted from single-core processors to multi-core processors. Traditional concurrent development on the Java Platform requires in depth knowledge of threads, locks, and queues (oh, my!).  Fortunately, new languages and frameworks that run on the Java Platform, such as Akka, have made concurrent programming easier.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I will demonstrate several concurrent processing techniques including Fire and Forget, Fork-Join, and Asynchronous Web Services using the Java Concurrency Library, the Akka Framework and Jersey (JAX-RS).\r\n\r\nSource Code: https://github.com/jtdeane",

                    "description": "Today, there are several trends that are forcing application architectures to evolve. Users expect a rich, interactive and dynamic user experience on a wide variety of clients including mobile devices. Applications must be highly scalable, highly available and run on cloud environments. Organizations often want to frequently roll out updates, even multiple times a day. Consequently, it’s no longer adequate to develop simple, monolithic web applications that serve up HTML to desktop browsers.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we describe the limitations of a monolithic architecture. You will learn how to use the scale cube to decompose your application into a set of narrowly focused, independently deployable back-end services and an HTML 5 client. We will also discuss the role of technologies such as NodeJS and AMQP brokers. You will learn how a modern PaaS such as Cloud Foundry simplifies the development and deployment of this style of application.\r\n",

But is it here to stay, or just a fad?\r\n\r\nWe can best answer that by looking at what Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) like Git bring to the world of programming and authoring. There are a myriad of benefits ranging from the distributed nature of Git *without* a central point of failure, to its focus on working locally. These benefits are made possible by Git efficiently communicating over the network only when asked and its Unix-like compositional architecture.\r\n\r\nWe'll follow that up with a look at what GitHub, a web service focused on amplifying Git for easier collaboration, brings to this rapidly changing domain of software creation tools.\r\n\r\nThis talk will enable you to sling the basic Git and GitHub lingo around like an old hat when you get back to the office.\r\n",

                    "description": "Simulation allows a rigorous, scalable, and reproducible approach to testing:\r\n\r\n#### Statistical modeling\r\n\r\nSimulation begins with statistical models of the use of your system. This model includes facts such as \"we have identified four customer profiles, each with different browsing and purchasing patterns\" or \"the analytics query for the management report must run every Wednesday afternoon.\"  Models are versioned and kept in a database.\r\n\r\n#### Activity streams\r\n\r\nThe statistical models are used to create activity streams. Each agent in the system represents a human user or external process interacting with the system, and has its own timestamped stream of interactions. With a large number of agents, simulations can produce the highly concurrent activity expected in a large production system.\r\n\r\n#### Distributed execution\r\n\r\nAgents are scaled across as many machines as are necessary to both handle the simulation load, and give access to the system under test.  The simulator coordinates time, playing through the activity streams for all the agents.\r\n\r\n#### Capture results\r\n\r\nEvery step of the simulation process, including modeling, activity stream generation, execution, and the code itself, is captured and stored in a database for further analysis. You will typically also capture whatever logs and metrics your system produces.\r\n\r\n#### Validation\r\n\r\nSince all phases of a simulation are kept in a database, validation can be performed at any time. This differs markedly from many approaches to testing, which require in-the-moment validation against the live system.\r\n\r\n#### Separation of concerns\r\n\r\nThe separation of concerns above, and the use of a versioned, time-aware database, gives simulation great power. Imagine that you get a bug report from the field, and you realize that the bug corresponds to a corner case that you failed to consider. With a simulation-based approach, you can write a new validation for the corner case, and run that validation against your past simulation results, without ever running your actual system.\r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce simulation testing, walking through a complete example using an open-source simulation library.\r\n",

                    "description": "Learning the syntax of a new language is easy, but learning to think under a different paradigm is hard. This session helps you transition from a Java writing imperative programmer to a functional programmer, using Java, Clojure and Scala for examples. This session takes common topics from imperative languages and looks at alternative ways of solving those problems in functional languages. As a Java developer, you know how to achieve code-reuse via mechanisms like inheritance and polymorphism. Code reuse is possible in functional languages as well, using high-order functions, composition, and multi-methods. I take a variety of common practices in OOP languages and show the corresponding mechanisms in functional languages. Expect your mind to be bent, but you’ll leave with a much better understanding of both the syntax and semantics of functional languages.",

Creativity is subject to the mood of the team -- it doesn't exactly ooze from a team that is demoralized. But how do you motivate creative types? It seems that it's as easier to demotivate knowledge workers than it is to motivate them. Or is it? Programmers, testers, analysts and product managers can be motivated if you just take care. Know what motivates teams in general, find out what motivates each individual, be observant, and use a couple simple \"tools\".

In this session we will discuss some of the concepts behind designing a REST based API, then illustrate an implementation using Spring MVC's powerful REST support. On the client side, we'll utilize Apple's iOS SDK to demonstrate how to make RESTful requests and consume data for presentation to the user.",

Due to the ever increasing amount of real time data and the need for real time analytics, alerting and reporting on this data, new patterns must be implemented to handle these requirements.\r\nIn the past data has typically been shared between EIP applications via messaging  or database which maybe too slow to meet SLA’s. In this discussion we will cover how to implement the following patterns/scenarios:\r\n\r\n* A Cache-Aside via the detour EIP pattern to retrieve or insert data in the distributed cache.\r\n* The “System of Record” pattern using EIP and distributed caching.\r\n* The Write-Behind pattern to asynchronously update the database using distributed caching.\r\n\r\nAn Ehcache gateway written using Spring Integration will demonstrate these patterns. In this discussion, a sample application will retrieve data from the FAA Airport Status Restful Service and share its information with other applications via a distributed cache. The ultimate goal of the presentation is to show developers that the data a EIP application processes can be shared real time with other applications in memory improving system wide performance.\r\n",

                    "description": "The WebSockets technology promises to fill a niche in web applications by enabling browsers and servers to exchange messages with high frequency, low latency and low bandwith requirements in full duplex mode. The WebSocket protocol is an IETF standard, the WebSocket API is almost standardized by the W3C, and the JSR-356 will deliver a Java API in Java EE 7. There are already implementations in node.js and in a number of Servlet containers and Java frameworks. The time is as good as ever to start digging into it and there is so much to consider — from getting familiar with the protocol and the API, to sorting through the choices on the browser and on the server side, practical challenges with browser support and network issues, and so on. Furthermore, WebSockets offer a messaging-style architecture that's in sharp contrast to the RESTful architectures that connect the web today, so learning where to draw the line will be essential.\r\n",

Programmers often have trouble reaping its benefits due to its uncontrolled flexibility and, to a certain extent, lack of structure. One approach is to learn to tame the beast, like the authors of complex JavaScript libraries have done. Fortunately there is an alternative. CoffeeScript is JavaScript created in a humane way. In this session we will learn how, using CoffeeScript, we can reap all the benefits of JavaScript, but without losing our sanity in the process.\r\n",

Yet there are still untapped possibilities for the cloud, including one overlooked area where the cloud can shine: testing. At Nexidia, we develop a large scale phonetic analytics framework, performing computational intensive operations across a cluster of servers, utilizing a MapReduce like strategy. This cluster can be as small as a single node, or as large as the needs demand. Testing large scale deployments in house has proven a real challenge; even with an unlimited budget, we cannot possibly anticipate all our future hardware requirements. The cloud has proven to be an excellent answer to this problem. With AWS (Amazon Web Services), we have developed a full automated testing harness in the cloud. This tool utilizes several of the AWS offerings:\r\n\r\n* EC2 provides the server instances to create deployments of (almost) any cluster size and server \r\ninstance type. \r\n* Custom AMI images, from which the instances are spawned, contain the bootstrap app \r\nresponsible for application installation and configuration upon instance initialization. \r\n* S3 storage hosts the test data. \r\n* Notifications are passed from and to the cluster via SQS. \r\n* VPC offers a private cloud, thus securing the cluster deployment.\r\n\r\nCosts are kept in check, as the server instances are terminated as soon as the test case is complete. Testing in the cloud allows us to explore corner cases, find bottlenecks in the application framework and helps us form recommendations and best practices for our clients. Along the way, we have learnt many lessons about the cloud, AWS, and testing in general. This presentation aims to educate and inform anyone looking to the cloud for testing possibilities.",

While the idea of \"actors\" is fundamentally simple, how do we, the software engineers, make use of this abstraction to develop real life, scalable systems? This talk designs a scalable distributed search service using Akka and Scala using the \"zen\" of Actor based design. It covers the basics of message passing, designing topologies and handling failure and moves onto a few common patterns in actors system design, including service overload detection and tracking user sessions.\r\n",

                    "description": "Remote pair programming is surprisingly simple and inexpensive to implement, but it’s not just about bleeding-edge technology — a good attitude is just as important as good technology. Joe will walk you through how your distributed team can successfully implement remote pair programming, allowing you to realize the same benefits as in-person pairing and address some of the challenges of distributed development. Joe will discuss the important personal and interpersonal skills needed for remote pairing as well as the technology.\r\n\r\nDistributed agile teams need not forgo the valuable discipline of pair programming. Thanks to ubiquitous high speed internet service, major advances in online collaboration technologies, and the need to source talent wherever they might be, remote pair programming is becoming more common.\r\n\r\n*Audience*: All members of software development teams who are interested in pair programming and distributed agile will benefit from this session. Developers will learn the nuts-and-bolts of remote pairing, product managers, business experts, etc. will learn how to integrate remote pairing developers seamlessly with the team. Attendees are invited to share their own remote collaboration experiences — good and bad.\r\n",
